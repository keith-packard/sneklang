# CircuitPython on Snekboard

You can download
[CircuitPython firmware for Snekboard from circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/snekboard/).

To install, press the blue reset button twice within about a
second. This should cause the blue LED to flash quickly and then pulse
slowly once it is connected to your laptop. It should appear as a new
device. Copy the firmware file to this device. Once installed,
Snekboard will restart running CircuitPython. You can use the Mu
editor to write code and talk to the device.
