Snekboard is a custom board designed to run Snek with
[Lego](https://www.lego.com)
[Power Functions](https://shop.lego.com/category/power-functions)
motors, servos and switches.

### Packaging ###

Snekboard is 48mm x 48mm, which is the same as six lego studs, so you
can build a Lego box and slip snekboard right inside.

### Power Supply ###

Snekboard uses a single cell lithium polymer battery for mobile
operations and can also be powered over USB. It includes a battery
charger circuit that operates whenever the board is plugged in.

Because Lego Power Function motors are designed to operate from a 9V
supply, snekboard includes a 4.5A 9V power supply, allowing it to
operate from a simple single lipo cell instead of requiring multiple
cells.

### Motor Controllers ###

Snekboard includes four 2.5A DC motor controlers which can drive
motors and servos. They connect to Power Functions motors using a
[Micro MaTch](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-215083-4.html)
crimp-on connector that attaches to Power Function cables.

### I/O Pins ###

Snekboard has 8 general purpose 3.3V I/O pins. Each is matched with a
ground and 3.3V power pin to allow them to be connected to sensors or
3.3V low-current devices. All eight pins can be used in analog or
digital mode.

### NeoPixels ###

There are two

devices on the board.

### CircuitPython ###

Snekboard can also run
[CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/),
for more advanced progamming adventures.

### Design Files ###

Snekboard is released under the [TAPR](https://www.tapr.org)
