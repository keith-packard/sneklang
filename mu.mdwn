## Mu Editor ##

The [Mu Editor](https://codewith.mu/) is a simple editor and
interaction window for Python languages, including Snek and
CircuitPython. We recommend using it with Snek as it provides an
integrated environment for exploring the language and connected Snek
hardware.

For now, Snek support is not upstream, so you'll need to download a
Snek-compatible version of Mu from here

[Mu packages are available in the dist directory here](dist)

Mu is written in Python, so getting it installed means getting Python
installed, along with a few other OS-specific pieces and then a pile
of Python code, which is mostly OS independent. There are a couple of
options available.

### Installing the '.whl' file ###

If you already have a working [Python3](https://www.python.org)
installation and just want to add mu to it, you can download the
latest .whl file and run

	pip install *.whl

### Installing for Windows ###

If you want an all-in-one package with a built-in installer, you can
download the windows installer exe file suitable for your machine.

 * [mu editor for 32-bit Windows](/dist/mu-editor-32bit.exe)
 * [mu editor for 64-bit Windows](/dist/mu-editor-64bit.exe)

### Installing for Debian ###

I've also built mu with snek support for Debian systems (and
derivatives). It should run on either Unstable or Stable (version 10,
aka “Buster”).  Mu can be installed from
[my personal package archive](https://keithp.com/archive).
Instructions on how to set that up for your machine are available in the
[README](https://keithp.com/archive/README) in that directory. That
archive also includes the Snek packages for Stable.
